<h1>FootBall</h1>


<p>I always loved football.
 When I was little I and my dad watched it on tv.
 When I was a little older he taught me how to play.
 First he taught me how to catch then how to throw. 
We loved to watch the super bowl.
 And on thanksgiving the rest of my family would come over to eat and watch football.
 Then all of the kids would go out and play it. 
After we would take a bath and go to sleep.
I joined my first team when I was nine.</P>


<p>In middle school I played for my church.
 I was a receiver and a running back.
 I was good at it I scored at least one touchdown every game.
 At the end of every game we would go and get pizza.
 I got along with all of my team mates. 
We were like a family. 
We only lost three games the whole season.</p>


<p>In middle school I played for maudin.
 That was my worst year we only won a few games.
 In middle school I played linebacker and receiver and sometimes running back.
 I could play whatever the coach needed me to play.
 My first day of practice was easy but during the year it got harder.
 We started practice early in the summer. We started by stretching. 
Then we had to lift weights that were the easiest part. 
Then we had to run again but this time for longer distances and longer times.
 At the end of practice my mom would get me something to eat. 
On the first game we had to wear our jerseys to school I was number eighty four.
 We lost our first game. At the next practice the coaches made us run even longer.
 That pretty much sums up my middle school year.</p>

<p>Now I'm in high school and I'm not playing for a team.
 But in still training with my friend.
 Every day we go outside and run routes and pass the ball.
 Sometimes we help his little brother play because this is his first year playing football.
 We start by running up the street to the library and walking back.
 Then we start passing the ball back and forth.
 Every time you drop the ball you have to do five push-ups.
 Then we come back tomorrow and do the same thing.</p>
